  <b>Site</b>: Enter a location using the <img src="css/icons/search.png">search tool on the map or click anywhere 
  on the map within the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area (visible area within the area enclosed by the blue line of 
  the study boundary) to obtain estimates of the average depth to ground water, elevation of 
  ground water, land-surface elevation, and the uncertainty of the values for the selected location.
 </p>
 <p>
  The point representing the site will appear as a red dot. Once the scale is at a zoom level of twelve or more
  a square box shaded according to depth with dark purples representing greater depths will appear instead of a 
  red dot. The box is 250 feet on each side and represents the maximum level of detail for the groundwater depth mapping. 
 </p>
 <p>
  To activate a popup message either hover or click the red dot or the purple-shaded polgon to display the estimates 
  of the average depth to ground water, elevation of ground water, land-surface elevation, and the uncertainty of 
  the values for the selected location. In addition the estimate of the average depth to ground water
  will also be displayed in the message box in the upper right of the map. Additional warnings will be displayed 
  if the location of the site is located outside of the the boundaries of the modelled area or outside of the study area.
