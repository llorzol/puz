   This application provides access to estimates of depth-to-water and water-table elevation for the 
   Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area, along with estimates of their relative uncertainty that were 
   developed in <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2008/5059/" target="_blank">Snyder (2009)</a>. The method 
   of analysis used to determine the water-table configuration relies on water-level data from shallow 
   wells and surface-water features that are representative of the water table (Dates of data used and when data were pulled).
   The water-table configuration data represent average conditions in the study area during 1929-2004.
   The precise position of the water table may differ from the estimated position at specific 
   locations, and short-term, seasonal, and long-term variations in the differences can be expected 
   (see Disclaimer). The values reported in this application represent the average water-table position for a 
   250 feet by 250 feet square area (as represented by the interpolation grid). This grid was generated from 
   datasets of depth-to-water and water-table elevation for the current study were interpolated independently 
   based on kriging as the method of interpolation with parameters determined through the use of 
   semivariograms developed individually for each dataset. Resulting interpolations were then combined to 
   create a single, averaged representation of the water-table configuration. Kriging analysis also was used to 
   develop a map of relative uncertainty associated with the values of the water-table position. Site-specific 
   estimates of the water-table position in areas of steep land-surface relief, steep water-table gradients, abrupt 
   local change in hydrogeologic properties, or strong stresses to the groundwater system such as 
   focused recharge or pumping, may result in water-table positions that differ from the average.

   Each estimate of the water-table position has an associated uncertainty. The relative uncertainty 
   data set provides a measure of the relative uncertainty associated with the estimates of the water-table 
   position at any location. The values of the relative uncertainty range from 0 to 1, where 0 
   represents a low relative uncertainty and 1 represents a high relative uncertainty. These values 
   provide a method to compare and evaluate the reliability associated with the values of the 
   water-table position. The relative uncertainty data set addresses some but not all possible errors 
   associated with the analysis of the water-table configuration and does not depict all sources of 
   uncertainty. In particular, perched groundwater zones may be present in some areas resulting in 
   the actual depth to water being less than estimated using the results of this study.
